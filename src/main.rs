/* 10.4 Styling - Styled - Longer */

// Anyone creating a website or application soon runs into the question
// of styling. For a small app, a single CSS file is probably plenty to
// style your user interface. But as an application grows, many developers
// find that plain CSS becomes increasingly hard to manage.

// Some frontend frameworks (like Angular, Vue, and Svelte) provide
// built-in ways to scope your CSS to particular components, making it
// easier to manage styles across a whole application without styles
// meant to modify one small component having a global effect. Other
// frameworks (like React or Solid) donâ€™t provide built-in CSS scoping,
// but rely on libraries in the ecosystem to do it for them. Leptos is
// in this latter camp: the framework itself has no opinions about CSS
// at all, but provides a few tools and primitives that allow others to
// build styling libraries.

// Here are a few different approaches to styling your Leptos app, other
// than plain CSS.

      // Variant not the issue, only the first
      // button in code is styled
        <Button variant=Variant::PRIMARY/>
        <Button variant=Variant::SECONDARY/>

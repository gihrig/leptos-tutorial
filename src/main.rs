// A Few Tips

// When thinking about control flow with Leptos, it’s important
// to remember a few things:

// 1. Rust is an expression-oriented language: control-flow
//    expressions like if x() { y } else { z } and
//    match x() { ... } return their values. This makes them
//    very useful for declarative user interfaces.
// 2. For any T that implements IntoView—in other words, for
//    any type that Leptos knows how to render—Option<T> and
//    Result<T, impl Error> also implement IntoView. And just
//    as Fn() -> T renders a reactive T, Fn() -> Option<T>
//    and Fn() -> Result<T, impl Error> are reactive.
// 3. Rust has lots of handy helpers like Option::map,
//    Option::and_then, Option::ok_or, Result::map, Result::ok,
//    and bool::then that allow you to convert, in a declarative
//    way, between a few different standard types, all of which
//    can be rendered.
//    Spending time in the Option and Result docs in particular
//    is one of the best ways to level up your Rust game.
// 4. And always remember: to be reactive, values must be functions.
//    You’ll see me constantly wrap things in a move || closure,
//    below. This is to ensure that they actually rerun when the
//    signal they depend on changes, keeping the UI reactive.

// To connect the dots a little: this means that you can actually
// implement most of your control flow with native Rust code,
// without any control-flow components or special knowledge.

// For example, let’s start with a simple signal and derived signal:

/*
  let (value, set_value) = create_signal(cx, 0);
  let is_odd = move || value() & 1 == 1;

  If you don’t recognize what’s going on with is_odd, don’t
  worry about it too much. It’s just a simple way to test
  whether an integer is odd by doing a bitwise AND with 1.
*/

// We can use these signals and ordinary Rust to build most
// control flow.

fn App(cx: Scope) -> impl IntoView {
    let (value, set_value) = create_signal(cx, 0);
    let is_odd = move || value() & 1 == 1;

    // Because it's just ordinary Rust code, you have all the power
    // of Rust’s pattern matching at your disposal.
    let message = move || match value() {
        0 => "Zero",
        1 => "One",
        2 => "Two",
        3 => "Three",
        4 => "Four",
        _ if value() > 6 => "Out of range",
        _ if is_odd() => "Odd",
        _ if !is_odd() => "Even",
        _ => "Unknown", // Never reached but compiler doesn't know
    };

    view! { cx,
        <h1>"Control Flow - Match Statements"</h1>

        // Simple UI to update and show a value
        <button on:click=move |_| set_value.update(|n| *n += 1)>
            "+1"
        </button>
        <p>"Value is: " {value}</p>

        <hr/>

        // match Statements

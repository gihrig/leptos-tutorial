// Youâ€™ll notice that throughout this example, `progress`
// takes a reactive ReadSignal<i32>, and not a plain i32.
// This is very important.

// Component props have no special meaning attached to them.
// A component is simply a function that runs once to set up
// the user interface. The only way to tell the interface to
// respond to changing is to pass it a signal type. So if you
// have a component property that will change over time, like
// our progress, it should be a signal.

      />
